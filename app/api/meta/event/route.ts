 * One route for the four pre-payment events: ViewContent, AddToCart,

 * Ankita uses a route per event. One route is fewer moving parts and the
 * payloads are identical apart from the name and the dedup key, but the
 * allow-list below is what keeps that from becoming a hole: only reviewed
 * names are accepted, and Purchase is explicitly NOT among them. Purchase is
 * only ever sent by the Razorpay webhook, where the payment is proven.
 *
 * The client IP and user agent are read from THIS request's headers, which is
 * the correct source: this is a fetch from the buyer's own browser. The
 * webhook's equivalent values have to travel via the order notes, because that
 * request comes from Razorpay.

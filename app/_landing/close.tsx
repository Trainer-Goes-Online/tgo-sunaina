              Sunaina is a Certified Yoga Teacher and Life Coach with 15+ years
              of guided practice and teaching, bringing together spiritual
              wisdom, practical coaching, yoga, meditation, pranayama,
              affirmations, storytelling and laughter therapy to work with the
              mind, body and inner self as a whole.

              Through years of practising and teaching these tools, she realised
              something simple: most people already know what could make them
              feel better. What they’re missing is an easy, structured and
              enjoyable way to bring it all together, stay consistent and have
              people doing it alongside them.

 * The mechanism, and it reads as "the five practices of the method" rather

 * comparison. Hairline-ruled rows with big lit ordinals: a ledger reads audited
 * and accountable, which is what sells competence. It is deliberately NOT
 * another icon-card grid, because the Experience section three screens up
 * already is one.

 *
 * The premium peak. The last thing the reader touches before paying, so it is
 * the most finished object on the page: a layered frame with a gold flourish
 * and ornament, a medallion seal, a hairline-ruled ledger with a value on
 * EVERY row (never one lump), and the value collapse dramatised: the ₹5,485
 * draws its own strike-through, then ₹497 pops in lit.
 *
 * The total is computed from the rows, never typed, so the ledger and the
 * total cannot disagree.
 *
 * It stays on the cream page. The brief is light-theme-only below the hero, so
 * the peak is earned with craft and depth rather than by turning the lights
 * off.

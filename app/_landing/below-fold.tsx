   The signature beat, and the page's ONE heavy motion moment.

   Six mornings are a genuine sequence: each one is described as building on
   the last, so the structure is a spine with a filling rail rather than six
   cards in a row. The rail's progress is a single CSS variable written by a
   rAF-throttled scroll handler; nodes ignite as the fill reaches them.

   ⚠️ FLAG FOR ATUL: the source heads this section "Your 5-Day Schedule" and
   then lists SIX days (DAY 01 to DAY 06), and the deck under it says "6
   mornings". Both are rendered exactly as written. One of the two numbers is
   wrong and only the client can say which. Not silently corrected here. */

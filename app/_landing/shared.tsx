 *
 * The colour derivation and the contrast maths behind every value here live in
 * ../../design-system.project.md. The short version:
 *
 *   SUNRISE. Warm IVORY is the environment, DEEP PLUM is the structure, GOLDEN
 *   APRICOT is the accent, and SUNRISE CORAL is the CTA. Espresso reads, warm
 *   taupe supports. Four icon beds, not seven.
 *
 *   The `gold*` token names hold apricot and the `coral*` names hold sunrise
 *   coral: each hue moved within its own family, so the names still describe
 *   what they carry. The plum family WAS called navy and was renamed, because
 *   that one no longer did.

     Warm ivory ground, a deep plum stage, and one sunrise that arrives in two
     temperatures: apricot for the light that is already up, coral for the
     moment it breaks. Espresso does the reading.

     Every value below is measured, not picked. The rule that governs the whole
     palette: a colour warm enough to feel like sunrise is never dark enough to
     be text. So each accent has a SURFACE tone and a separate INK tone, and

 *  prop is gone rather than defaulted, so a second appearance cannot come back.

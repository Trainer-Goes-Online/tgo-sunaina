/**
 * Section 7 · proof.
 *
 * ONE proof surface: nine exhibit-framed video cards. The screenshot wall that
 * used to sit under it is cut. Its source table was empty and no assets were
 * ever supplied, and nine real clients on camera do not need a second, weaker
 * form of the same claim propping them up.
 *
 * 7a IS LIVE: nine real client clips, supplied by Atul, hosted on the Trainer
 * GoesOnline Vimeo account and embedded as players rather than as files. Their
 * true dimensions are 240x426, so the frame is 9/16 and nothing letterboxes.
 * Every iframe is lazy: nine eager Vimeo players would each pull the platform's
 * own runtime on first paint. The names are the only meta shown, exactly as
 * supplied, with no invented city, star rating, quote or result.
 *
 * PendingFrame stays: it is the empty state for any card whose clip is pulled
 * or replaced later, so a missing id reads as a reserved frame rather than as a
 * hole in the grid.

/**
 * The business facts every legal page needs.
 *
 * FILLED (31 Aug 2026). No field renders as a placeholder any more, so the
 * policy pages and the footer identity block are safe to show.
 *
 * TWO things are still worth confirming before this takes money, both marked
 * with a warning below and neither visible on the page: the PIN code is missing
 * from `address`, and `entity` must match the PAN record exactly. A policy
 * naming the wrong entity is worse than no policy.
 *
 * The values are collected here rather than scattered through three pages so it
 * is one edit, and so a placeholder cannot hide in a paragraph.
 *
 * They render on the page as written, so an unfilled one is visible to anyone
 * who opens the privacy policy rather than buried in a file nobody reads.
 *
 * `entity` and `tradeName` are TWO fields, not one, and both are needed before
 * the pages read correctly. Most of these clients are sole proprietorships,
 * which have no separate legal person: the individual IS the entity and is
 * what appears on the PAN and GST record, while the business name is what the
 * buyer recognises. The law wants the person named; the page wants the brand.
 * Collapsing them into one field gets one of the two audiences wrong, so ask
 * which structure the business actually is before filling either.

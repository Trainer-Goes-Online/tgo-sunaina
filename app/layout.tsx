/**
 * Two faces, three voices.
 *
 * Plus Jakarta Sans (display) is a geometric humanist sans, set at 700 for
 * every title on the site. Display presence comes from WEIGHT and scale rather
 * than from a serif's stroke contrast, which is the trade this face makes.
 *
 * Inter (body) does the reading at 17px / 1.65, and everything that is not a
 * title: labels, eyebrows, buttons, UI numerals. The two share a humanist sans
 * skeleton, so they sit together without friction while staying distinct in
 * weight and temperament.
 *
 * The third voice, the "spec" one that labels and credentials use, is tracked
 * uppercase Inter 700 rather than a monospace. That is a deliberate exception to
 * the house three-voice rule: a mono reads clinical against a stillness,
 * breathwork and affirmations offer, and tracked caps do the same job in the
 * right register. Noted in design-system.project.md.

/* Plus Jakarta Sans at 700, for titles. A geometric humanist sans: the display
   job here is carried by WEIGHT and scale rather than by a serif's contrast.

   Two weights, and only two. 700 is every title. 500 exists for exactly one
   element, the pull-quote in close.tsx, which is deliberately quieter than a
   heading and was set at medium long before this face arrived. The family is
   variable and could ship anything from 200 to 800; loading the two that are
   actually used keeps the payload honest and makes a synthesised weight
   impossible by construction.

   Every display element carries an explicit `font-bold` or `font-medium`, and
   `h1/h2/h3` set 700 in globals.css, so nothing can land on this face at a
   weight it was not loaded with. */

/* The live origin. Without a metadataBase Next resolves every share URL and
   every relative OG asset against localhost, so a link pasted into WhatsApp
   previews as a dead local address.

   This is deliberately defensive, because metadataBase is evaluated at BUILD
   time on every route including the generated /_not-found. A bad value here
   does not degrade the page, it fails the deploy:

     `??` does NOT catch an empty string. A host that defines the variable with
     a blank value (Vercel does exactly this when the key is added without one)
     gives new URL('') and ERR_INVALID_URL, which is what broke the Kaizen
     build.

   So: fall back on any falsy value rather than only on null, add the protocol
   if someone pastes a bare domain, and if it still will not parse, use the
   literal rather than throwing.

   ⚠️ PLACEHOLDER. The launch domain is not known yet, so FALLBACK_ORIGIN is
   still example.com. Replace it with the real origin, and keep it identical to
   `fallbackEventSourceUrl` in lib/checkout-config.ts. */

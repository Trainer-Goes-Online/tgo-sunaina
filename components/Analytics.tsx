/**
 * The GA4 base tag and the Microsoft Clarity tag, both driven by env rather
 * than pasted into the layout by hand.
 *
 * This exists because every GA4 call in lib/ga4.ts checks for `window.gtag`
 * and returns quietly when it is absent. Without a base tag on the page, that
 * check never passes: view_item, add_to_cart, begin_checkout, add_payment_info
 * and the browser copy of purchase all silently do nothing, and the failure
 * looks exactly like a working site. The server-side purchase from the Razorpay
 * webhook keeps reporting through the Measurement Protocol, which makes the
 * gap harder to spot, not easier: GA4 shows revenue with no funnel above it.
 *
 * Both tags render nothing when their id is missing, so an unfilled env var
 * leaves no broken script tag behind.
 *
 * afterInteractive, not beforeInteractive: neither tag is needed for first
 * paint, and the first event this page fires (view_item) is dispatched from
 * FunnelTracker's effect, which runs after hydration.

/**
 * Meta Conversions API primitives, shared by every server-side event route.
 *
 * Ported from ankita-postpartum with ONE deliberate change: this sends only
 * Meta's STANDARD event names. Ankita fires a custom `sales` event alongside
 * Purchase; that is dropped here. A custom event duplicating a standard one
 * adds no information and competes with it for Aggregated Event Measurement
 * priority on iOS, where standard names rank first.
 *
 * ── Health and wellness classification hygiene ────────────────────────────
 * Meta classifies a dataset into its restricted "Health and wellness
 * condition" category by reading a handful of surfaces, and a restriction,
 * once applied, binds at the ROOT DOMAIN and is not cleanly reversible. This
 * offer is a wellness practice sold against how a person feels in their body
 * and their mind (stress, energy, sleep, racing thoughts), so the intrinsic
 * nature of the product is a signal we cannot remove. Every signal we CAN
 * remove is removed here, and that means the two surfaces this file owns:
 *
 *   `custom_data`: value, currency and order_id ONLY. No `content_name`, no
 *   product string, no category, no UTM, no fbclid. custom_data is NOT hashed
 *   and IS read, so a product name arriving on every event is a plain-text
 *   declaration of what is being sold, and `utm_campaign` values are written
 *   by media buyers and drift toward symptom language with nobody reviewing
 *   them.
 *
 *   `event_source_url`: reduced to the ORIGIN. A path carries the same
 *   declaration in the same crawl.
 *
 * The standard event NAMES are deliberately kept. Coded custom events
 * (`evt_a`) are the belt-and-braces variant of this posture, but they forfeit
 * Aggregated Event Measurement priority, the built-in Purchase optimisation
 * and every standard-event prior in the ad account. The payload and the URL
 * are where the classification risk actually lives; the names are where the
 * performance lives. This keeps the performance and removes the risk.
 *
 * `user_data` is untouched and stays maximal: it is all SHA-256 hashed, it is
 * what EMQ is scored on, and it declares nothing about the offer.

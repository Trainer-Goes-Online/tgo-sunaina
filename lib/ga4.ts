/**
 * GA4 events, standard ecommerce names only.
 *
 * Ankita's version fires `initiate_checkout`, which is Meta's vocabulary sent
 * to Google: GA4 does not recognise it, so its built-in checkout funnel stays
 * empty. These are GA4's recommended names, so the funnel and revenue reports
 * populate with no custom configuration.
 *
 * Money IS sent. Ankita deliberately omits value and currency ("pure event
 * counts"), which keeps GA4 unable to answer what anything cost or earned.
 *
 * All failures are swallowed: analytics must never throw into a click.

/**
 * Pabbly Connect: the fulfilment hand-off.
 *
 * Analytics tells Meta and GA4 that a sale happened. This tells the automation
 * who bought, so the buyer actually receives what they paid for: the Inner
 * Circle WhatsApp invite, the joining details, the guide downloads, the row in
 * a sheet.
 *
 * It is fired from the Razorpay webhook and nowhere else, for the same reason
 * the Purchase event is: the webhook is the only place a payment is proven, and
 * UPI buyers routinely never return to the confirmation page. A browser-side
 * hand-off would silently skip most Indian buyers.
 *
 * Failure here must never fail the webhook. Razorpay retries a non-200, and a
 * retry would re-fire Meta and GA4 and double-count the sale. So this reports
 * its own success and swallows its own errors: the caller logs the result and
 * still returns 200.
 *
 * ── Why this payload carries the Meta match keys too ──────────────────────
 * Pabbly is not only fulfilment; it is the ONLY place the full, unhashed
 * record of a sale exists. Meta receives hashes and nothing descriptive, GA4
 * receives no PII at all, and Razorpay holds only what it needs to charge a
 * card. So `fbc`, `fbp`, `client_ip_address`, `client_user_agent`,
 * `external_id` and `purchase_event_id` ride along here as well: they are
 * what makes it possible to rebuild, replay or reconcile a Meta event later
 * from the sheet, without which a mis-sent conversion is unrecoverable.
 *
 * Never remove a key once Pabbly's steps map it. Removing one does not error,
 * it silently blanks a column downstream.
